# Project Topic: A comprehensive analysis of factors influencing Airbnb Listing Performance and Pricing in Melbourne.

Objectives
1.	To identify the key factors that influence the pricing of Airbnb listings.
2.	To analyse the impact of location, property type, and amenities on listing prices.
3.	To examine the relationship between listing performance metrics for example, (number of reviews, ratings) and their determining factors.
Research Questions
1.	What are the key factors that determine the price of an Airbnb listing?
•	How do geographical location, property type, and availability control price?
•	What is the impact of specific amenities on listing price?
2.	How does host characteristics (e.g., experience, number of listings, response rate) affect listing performance?
•	Is there a correlation between host experience and the average rating or number of bookings?
•	Do experienced hosts manage higher-priced listings?
3.	What is the relationship between listing ratings and the number of reviews?
•	How do the number of reviews and average ratings correlate with each other?
•	Are higher-rated listings more likely to receive more reviews?

Hypothesis
1.	Price vs. Location: - Rachael
•	Hypothesis: Listings in central areas have higher average prices than listings in the outskirts locations.
•	Test: Compare average prices between central and outskirts locations using a t-test.
2.	Price Vs Property Type: - Rhea
•	Hypothesis: Entire homes/apartments are prices higher than private or shared rooms.
•	Test: Perform ANOVA to compare the average prices across different property types.
3.	Price vs Number of Reviews: - Monica
•	Hypothesis: Listings with a higher number of reviews tend to have higher prices.
•	Test: Use correlation analysis to examine the relationship.
4.	Rating vs. Price: - Lauren
•	Hypothesis: Higher-rated listings are more expensive
•	Test: Use correlation analysis and regression analysis to test this hypothesis.
5.	Host Characteristics vs Price and Ratings: - Monica
•	Hypothesis: Listings with more experienced host tend to be priced higher
•	Test: Use regression analysis to test this hypothesis
6.      Amenities vs Price
        Hypothesis: Price of properties with all 5 amenities tend to be higher than that of properties without all 5 amenities. - Rhea 
        Test: Use T-test to test this hypothesis
    
Methodology and Distribution of Tasks

Tasks	Name	Description	Responsible person
Task 1	Data Collection and Pre-processing

•Gather data from Airbnb’s publicly available data sets.
•	Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
	Lauren
 
Task 2	Exploratory Data Analysis	•	Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and trends of key variables.
•	Use visualisations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, line graphs) to explore relationships between variables.	All

Task 3	Location-Based Analysis	•	Use geographical visualisations (e.g., Maps, heat maps) to analyse the distribution of listings and prices.
•	Identify popular neighbourhoods and analyse their average prices.	Rachael

Task 5	Rating- Based Analysis	•	Formulate hypothesis based on ratings vs prices and use visualisation and correlation analysis to test the hypothesis	Lauren

Task 6	Property Type-Based Analysis	•	Formulate hypothesis regarding property type vs prices.
•	Perform ANOVA to test these hypotheses.	    Rhea

Task 7	Host Experience and Listing Performance	•	Group listings by host and analyse performance metrics (e.g., average rating, number of bookings).
•	Use correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to examine the relationships.	Monica

Task 8 Amenities-based analysis  •	Formulate hypothesis regarding the Airbnb listings with & without the top 5 Airbnb amenities vs prices
Test: Use T-test to compare the categories and test the hypothesis.  Rhea

Expected Outcomes
•	Identification of key factors influencing Airbnb listing prices.
•	Insights into how location, property type, and amenities impact pricing.
•	Understanding the relationship between host characteristics and listing performance.
•	Validated hypothesis with statistical significance.

Tools and Technologies to be used.
•	Python - for data analysis and modelling
•	Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,Scipy, GeoPandas among others
•	Requests – APIs (Geoapi)
•	Visualisation Tools - Matplotlib

Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing Airbnb listing performance and pricing, incorporating scientific analysis through hypothesis testing. By understanding these relationships and statistically validating them, Airbnb hosts and analysts can make informed decision to optimize listings for better performance and pricing strategies.
